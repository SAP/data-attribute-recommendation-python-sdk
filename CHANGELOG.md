# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0]

## Changed

* `InferenceClient.create_inference_request*` methods now default to `retry=True`. [130]

## [0.12.0]

### Changed

* `InferenceClient.do_bulk_inference` is now faster due to processing requests in parallel [#128]
* `InferenceClient.do_bulk_inference` is more resilient and handles errors internally. Instead of
   raising an Exception if the inference request to the service fails, the `do_bulk_inference` method
   will place a special error response object in the returned list. This can be considered a breaking API change,
   because the special error response object will have a value of `None` for the `labels` key.
   As this project is still versioned below 1.0.0, the breaking API change does not warrant a major version update.
   See [#128] for details.
* Improve reliability by tweaking retry configuration [#129]

[#129]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/129

## [0.11.0]

### Added

* Support for reading training jobs using model name in `read_job_by_model_name`

[#124]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/124

## [0.10.0]

### Added

* Support for inference using external URL in `create_inference_request_with_url`

[#122]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/122

## [0.9.2]

### Added

* Notebooks for showcasing model template usage. [#116]
  * Notebook for showcasing generic model template.
  * Notebook for showcasing hierarchical model template.
  * Notebook for showcasing regression model template.

[#116]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/116

## [0.9.1]

### Added

* Support for Business Blueprint API. [#118]
  * This feature is **not supported** in DAR service yet, it is added for internal testing purposes.
  * `read_business_blueprint_template_collection` method to list business blueprint templates collection.
  * `read_business_blueprint_template_by_id` method to fetch information of a specific business blueprint template for the given business_blueprint_id

[#118]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/118

## [0.9.0]

### Added

* Support for Business blueprint id in `create_job` and `create_job_and_wait` methods. [#114]
  * This feature is **not supported** in DAR service yet, it is added for internal testing purposes.
  * Either model_template_id or business_blueprint_id has to be specified in `create_job` method.
  * Both model_template_id and business_blueprint_id are not allowed.

[#114]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/114

## [0.8.2]

### Fixed

* HTTP errors sent by the Data Attribute Recommendation service are now reported correctly
  as a `DARHTTPException` (including debug information) even when the request was retried. [#109]
  Fixes [#104]

[#109]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/109
[#104]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/issues/104

### Changed

* Remove passing of external deployment ID and job ID from SDK API. This functionality
  never materialized in the Data Attribute Recommendation service and is now also removed in
  the SDK.
  This is an API change in the SDK because it changes the method signature of some
  methods to remove the optional `job_id` and `deployment_id` arguments. Passing these arguments
  always resulted in an error returned by the Data Attribute Recommendation service. For this
  reason, this change is not a breaking change.
  This change effectively reverts [#98].
* Plain-text `http://` URLs are now allowed for `localhost`. This is useful for local
  development. [#108]

[#107]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/107
[#108]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/108

## [0.8.1]

### Fixed

* Fix specification of dependencies. The SDK package was incorrectly depending
  on an older version of the requests package. If you have installed 0.8.0, it is
  recommended to update to 0.8.1 and also ensure you have the latest dependencies. [#102]

[#102]: https://github.com/SAP/data-attribute-recommendation-python-sdk/pull/102

## [0.8.0]

### Added

* Add [CONTRIBUTING.md] and [SECURITY.md] [#92]
* This project is now following the [Best Practices] set forth by the
  Core Infrastructure Initiative! See [CII badge details]. [#92]
* Add `construct_from_cf_env` method to construct client instances from
  Data Attribute Recommendation service binding on SAP Business Technology
  Platform. [#97]
* Add support for user-specified Job and Deployment IDs when creating the
  respective Job and Deployment resources. This change is not yet generally
  available in the Data Attribute Recommendation service. [#98]
